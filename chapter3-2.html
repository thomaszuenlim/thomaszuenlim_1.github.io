Moving into version 2 of the paper prototyping phase, there are several main features that we aim to get further insight into. This is the first prototype that features budgeting, in addition to sign up and sign in and tutorial screens at the end of the onboarding process

          <li><p><strong>2.1.1</strong><br>Sign in with Apple is unfamiliar to many of the users we tested with, Sign in with Google is far more universally understood <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.2</strong><br>We need to communicate the full features of the Sign in and Register options <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.3</strong><br>As this is now the second time this has been brought up, we need to reconsider how we present additional options to the user. Additionally, we had feedback from one user who would not prefer squared boxes since it conflicted with the overall design language of the application. Perhaps there is a way we can skip either of these and come back to the fundamentals? <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.4</strong><br>This should be implemented, we cannot assume that all users are comfortable with swiping between the different pages of the tutorial screen <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.5</strong><br>While we’ve almost solved the approach for multiple accounts, we’ve now realised we need to approach this in a ‘micro’ approach. Many users will have multiple bank accounts and we need to accommodate for this <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.6</strong><br>There are several levels of user interaction in this issue. One, for custom categories, that is something we can implement with ease in the next design. However, we may need to consider pushing adding or removing budget categories into the backlog, as it is a feature that may introduce new functionality <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.7</strong><br>The language for registering an account should be reflected in the signing up options, this must be implemented <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.8</strong><br>This is possible an error on our part. We weren’t careful enough to remove the value in the budget setup process and this will be reflected in the next iteration <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.9</strong><br>This is quite interesting, and is something we wholeheartedly agree on. We should present the user with the data that we have been provided with, it is the responsibility of the application to do so, especially in the name of transparency. However, for now, this seems to be more of a backend requirement, in addition to working with the financial account services to ensure this behaviour <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.1.10</strong><br>Following from the changes proposed in 2.1.6 this is now sufficiently provided. We will remove this confusing line of text from this screen <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>2.2.2</strong><br>Users are familiar with the current position of the ‘left to spend’ dialog and this is associated with the budget circle.

Additionally, we included the amount just spent in the same box for continued familiarity <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>2.2.4</strong><br>This is an interesting back and forth, but it was clear that our paper prototype v2 testers felt more strongly about this change, and hence we have decided to return to the ‘Close’ button language for the end of the payment process <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.2.5</strong><br>The POS transactional information would provide a great level of recognition and recall for the user, while also possibly providing a depth of information that could potentially solve the problem identified.

          <li><p><strong>2.3.2</strong><br>This is something to consider, however, we do recognise that we still have the budget circle present in the card of the Spending screen, which we feel presents a better visual aid for budget progress as opposed to a percentage, since it provides a relative position from an immediate glance. <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>2.5.1</strong><br>When considering our notifications, we looked at two slightly different approaches. One can be found in our standard iOS notifications behaviour, where notifications continue to pile in the list, but there is a subtle ‘New’ and ‘Older’ organisation via a no label section for new and ‘notification center’ for older, read notifications. The second can be found in the way that Facebook handles notifications. Users receive a notification badge number, but unread notifications continue to have a slight colour shift to let the user know that they haven’t clicked on the notification yet. Between these two, we’ve felt that the depth of our application’s notifications don’t quite reach the level of Facebook, and hence will be looking towards something closer to ‘New’ and ‘Older’ <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.5.2</strong><br>A cog or gear icon seems to be the clear consensus of the universal settings icon, and hence we will be continuing with that <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.5.3</strong><br>Following on from behaviour we researched in 2.5.1, we’ve decided to take a hybrid approach. Hence the behaviour here would provide users with a notification badge to alert them of a new notification, but by returning to any other feature in the app via the navigation bar, will clear the unread badge on the notifications icon <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.5.4</strong><br>This is something we didn’t pick up on our own but is very important to the user’s cognitive load and expectation.

Budgeting features were not implemented in paper prototype 1, but it was clear that its absence was causing some confusion when it came to seeing budget limits in the pay screens of the previous iteration. Hence, one of the major focuses of paper prototype 2 was to begin to explore the depth of budgeting that our users would expect as part of an integrated financial solution. There was some A/B testing provided here, in order to test how users would like to be presented with features like scrolling through budgeting categories.

          <li><p><strong>2.6.5</strong><br>Maybe add a breakdown of the budget so we can see how much of the budget was made up of a certain category</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.6.6</strong><br>Is this viewing the budget for all the cards? Or are we able to individually control card budgets?</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>2.6.1</strong><br>‘Spent overall’ isn’t as clear as possible, even though we might have been a bit lazy and kept the spent value at $5800.

          <li><p><strong>2.6.2</strong><br>This is an important feature to include, especially for easier viewing.

          <li><p><strong>2.6.3</strong><br>While we could implement this behaviour, there is information present in the overall time period summary which we feel is important information to have on the same screen, especially for comparing budget category amounts to the total budget <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>2.6.4</strong><br>In light of 2.6.4, 2.6.5 and 2.6.7, these three issues can be solved together. In conjunction with 2.6.1, we can use the extra white space to add in the amount budgeted, in addition to a pie chart that had colour coded segments to reflect associated budget categories. To assist with this, the circles to the left of the budget categories will become icons, and there could be an additional line of text below the category amount which reflects the category budget <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>

              Following the feedback and plans from the paper prototype 2, there is a little bit more nuance to consider within budgeting. The introduction to the tutorial screen was received well, in addition to the initial budget setup.
<br><br>
Moving forward into high fidelity, we do feel like the amount of testing that we’ve been able to conduct will greatly help in reducing usability issues that may arise in the next iteration.
