          For paper prototype version 1, we decided to present the primary features to the user in order to gain insights into what seemed familiar and what was miscommunicated. The primary goals here were to determine if we were on the right track and get the big glaring issues out of the way first as much as possible.
          <br><br>
          Due to some screens that we felt could be designed in separate ways, we decided to use methods like A/B testing to see which versions users preferred or possible elements they would like combined. This was also used in conjunction with usability testing, with ourselves moderating and observing what our users were doing while going through the application.
          <br><br>
          We should also note that our paper prototyping had initially began as hand drawn sketches, which we then moved to Balsamic to create wireframes. However, we felt that there were far more screens that we wanted to test, and hence we moved the creation of wireframes into Sketch in order to have the tools to be able to create enough screens that would better represent this application and its functions for version 1 testing.
          <br><br>
          These wireframes were still printed out on paper for users to physically interact with.

          In this onboarding process, the user is taken through a setup process for the financial accounts they might be interested in adding. This is a major part of the application being able to support users throughout their lifecycle, as financial priorities change over time.
          <br><br>
          The main usability test for Paper Prototype was aimed primarily at ensuring that the entire process was simple and straightforward.

In the Pay page, users are able to make mobile purchases with cards linked to the application, a digital copy of the one issued by their banks. There are 3 variations that were A/B tested here, primarily around how budget would be visualised as well as the addition of transactional data.

The current system is that the colour indicator is filling up from zero to 100%, which is from green to red, but the user is not adding money, but using money. Therefore, the circle gauge should be starting from full colour, which is green to little gauge, which is red colour</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>1.2.10</strong><br>Do all the back buttons on the Pay screen make sense, like perhaps when you have already made a payment, should the back button still be there?

          <li><p><strong>1.2.5</strong><br>This is something to consider for a more fully fledged payment and budgeting design but may be implemented at a later point in time. In consideration, we found that this could overcomplicate the pay screen, and was not implemented for the future iterations</p></li>

In the spending page, users can view more information related to their cards. This includes information like balance, budget limits and recent transactions. There are two variations in this version, primarily aimed towards how users would like to view this information and how they would get there. One is a single page scrolling design, and the other is a split version, where they select the card they want to view information about.        </p>

          <li><p><strong>1.3.6</strong><br>This feedback further supports the one page direction, as it doesn’t seem too necessary to enable the user to choose a card from the spending page to pay with. It is essentially just having the pay screen within the spending screen. <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.3.7</strong><br>Upon thinking that perhaps 3-5 days may be a good timeframe, we’ve realised that one person could very possibly make hundreds of transactions within that timespan. Hence, we’ve changed our course of thinking to be based on the number of transactions; i.e. perhaps shown a limit of ten? Additionally, it doesn’t seem like it would be overly necessary to have a separate page for viewing more transactions and for now, we’d most likely stay with 10 as default, but allow users to load more when they reach the end. <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>

The track page is where users can view all the financial activity that may occur in the financial accounts they have chosen to access through the application. It was important that users feel like all of their accounts are transparent and readily viewable, like most recent activity or even analytical information.

          <li><p><strong>1.4.2</strong><br>The labels for the different tiles are confusing, as I might have multiple bank accounts which means that the tiles might end up being labelled the same</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.3</strong><br>When a user hit the card to see detailed information, the word ‘Banking’ goes from left to right and it is confusing</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>1.4.5</strong><br>The label next to the Track in the top right is slightly confusing, should it be so readily available?</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.6</strong><br>Some graphs are less useful than others for different accounts, like a weekly view for superannuation would be useless; perhaps tailored graph views for different accounts (like quarterly for superannuation)?</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>1.4.11</strong><br>Would like the swiping between accounts, but wasn’t a fan of how the main tile information was changed to look more like it was part of the background and no longer looked like a tile</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.12</strong><br>Would the user be able to see better graph information, like being able to tap on a specific datapoint? This could make the yearly graph more useful</p></li>

          <li><p><strong>1.4.2</strong><br>Definitely considered and will need to be implemented, users need to be able to know exactly which account they are looking at, even more so when it comes to their finances <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.3</strong><br>May need to remove the labels that were designed to let the user know what account they are currently viewing when entering the ‘more info’ view. It is slightly confusing because users are only one level away from the main track screen <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.4</strong><br>This is interesting because what has been described is essentially the one page Track screen with scrolling, assuming that they have only a few accounts to track which means that there would be no scrolling. However, scrolling is inevitably going to happen as more accounts are added, like several different accounts under one bank account, which would ultimately result in the same thing. <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.5</strong><br>Being able to add a new financial account isn’t a function that needs to be so readily available, and hence may need to be moved to the settings page. <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.6</strong><br>This issue was a difficult one to justify. On one hand, we agree that some graph views are going to be more useful than others, like a daily graph for investments vs superannuation and hence perhaps we should indeed have individually created graph controls. However, in consideration of the possible development of such an application, it is important to consider what is possible as a designer as opposed to a developer. Rather, we feel that from a developer’s view, creating one library for financial graphs to use across all accounts would greatly reduce application memory and usage requirements. For this reason, we’ve decided to continue with the current design that has the same graph view controls across all financial accounts <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.7</strong><br>Implementing features like this were part of other design concepts prior to this application, however, were ultimately left out in this initial design due to the increased complexity and density of information being presented to the user. We do agree that this is something that the application should have, since all the data is there, but for now is something we may push to the backlog in order to focus on improving what is currently there <br>(Backlogged)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.8</strong><br>Pagination dots that indicate the number of accounts a user may have tracked will need to move to a more accessible and viewable position. <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.9</strong><br>This is something to consider for the high fidelity stage, but we feel it might make more sense as an ‘overlay’ and not push the other tiles out but this behaviour could change by the time we reach high fidelity <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.10</strong><br>Linked to the pagination dots, perhaps we need to include the names of the accounts in a more prominent position, in addition to utilising greys to show the user that they can get to that account <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.11</strong><br>In moving forward with the swiping between accounts, we could do a hybrid of the two where we keep the tile setup, but can swipe between the different financial accounts horizontally <br>(Change made for Paper Prototype V2)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.12</strong><br>This is a feature we should indeed implement, however, we decided that this could be better communicated in the high fidelity stage <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V1)</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>1.4.13</strong><br>This could be very interesting behaviour to have, however, there are some financial accounts that may only have one tile to view more of. Additionally, in keeping with the idea of removing the labels for 1.4.3, we may need to restrict such behaviour to swiping only between tiles of the same account otherwise this could be very confusing. <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>

As more ‘minor’ features of the application, notifications and settings are intended more to round out the application. Being notified of immediate changes to any of your financial accounts is very important behaviour and it currently reflects this. There is also an A/B test for the settings icon, as we decided to look into this small part of the user flow. We wanted to compare if users would prefer to have to get to their profile through settings or vice versa.

            <p>
              In reflection on the Paper Prototype version 1 usability testing, we quickly realised that there is much more to budgeting that previously realised. There is a level of depth that seems to be the major reason why so many budgeting apps exist.
              <br><br>
              It made us consider whether we were aiming to achieve too much with this mobile application, especially when so many other budgeting apps do one thing, but do them incredibly well with immense depth.             </p>
