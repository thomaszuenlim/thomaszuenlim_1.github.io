          <em>Task 1 was an individually completed task, and we have included summaries from both Thomas Lim and Milton Kim.</em>
<br><br><br>
          <h4>Thomas Lim</h4><br>
          In task 1, by analysing the collected data gathered through techniques like affinity diagramming and developing insights, there were several patterns that emerged in relation to financial literacy and financially-induced stress.
          <br><br>
          The data revealed that all participants acknowledged that it was beyond just saving money. Many identified financial literacy as having an understanding of spending less than you earn, investing money into shares and property, being fully aware of the interest, tax and fees you are subject to paying as well as maximising the benefits of your superannuation.
          <br><br>
          We also found that there were various financial strategies that participants of a range of ages employed. For many young adults early in their career, there was a clear gap in financial knowledge regarding what rules or strategies they should apply to their current situation.
          <br><br>
          There was also an identifiable shift in financial priorities as we gathered data from increasingly older participants. Financial priorities shifted in young adults who were more focused on entering the stock and property market, to older generations who were looking to retire on their superannuation.
          From this research, we could conclude that financial stress is on the rise, primarily due to the increasing cost of living. Additionally, financial priorities change over time through a person’s life cycle, and there is a level of stress that comes with trying to navigate through this all alone.
<br><br><br>
          <h4>Milton Kim</h4><br>
          It is reported that many Australians have a hard time managing their financial situation and some people are unavailable to raise upwards of $2000 when they face a financial emergency situation (Marjolin 2017). Moreover, less fortunate people end up spending more money since they are suppressed not to spend money all the time and it stimulates them to spend much more money psychologically after all (Vohs 2013).
          <br><br>
          Indeed, the pattern of overspending after overcoming urges makes one’s financial situation worse and it is problematic in that it can be repeated as their financial situation could change irregularly. When people are unfamiliar with their financial knowledge and has less money, it is inevitable to be in trouble when they need to raise a big amount of money for emergency situations. Financial stress, compensation psychology for overcoming the urges and physical financial situation are all interrelated. Lack of education and poor self-control makes not only a person’s financial literacy low, but it affects their society’s financial health.
