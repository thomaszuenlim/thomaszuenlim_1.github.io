        <p>
          Moving into high fidelity prototypes for versions 3 and 4, the biggest cosmetic change was the addition of the application theme colours and patterns Additionally, every element that was part of the paper prototype took on more colour and depth to better communicate interactions as a whole. This process began in Sketch, designing each of the screens at a high fidelity level, while then moving on to creating simple interactive prototypes in Pop for version 3 testing, and finally moving this into more complex and custom interactions completed in Principle for version 4. By adding this level of user interactivity, version 3 and 4 saw a major shift in our usability testing, as we started to introduce our users to think aloud methods as we gave them tasks to complete. This proved to help immensely in measuring the response times for completing tasks, as well as letting users begin to feel more in control, as though there were no limitations to what they could play with within the prototype.

                      <li><p><strong>3.3.2</strong><br>As users scrolled up and down the recent transaction list, there were several who expressed maybe being able to view a bit more on the screen? Maybe perhaps the card that takes up quite a large bit of the screen becomes minimised to give more screen real estate for scrolling the transaction list?</p></li>
                      <li><p><strong>3.3.3</strong><br>There are two unexpected actions that occurred during the high fidelity testing. One was that tapping on a card in this spending screen took you to the pay screen for that chosen card. Two, tapping on the spending limit information in the spending screen took the user to the view budget option in the settings menu. Both of these actions were surprises to the testers, which might not be behaviour we want at this point in time?</p></li>

                      <li><p><strong>3.3.1</strong><br>This is valid feedback, however, we realise that we have two elements on the screen with different interactions. We have a swiping card interaction that allows users to switch between each of their cards, and we also have a scrolling interaction for our recent transactions. Keeping these two interactions as far apart as possible greatly reduces any confusion between these two dimensions of interaction. I.e. If the transactions were directly below the card, users may start to be confused because the area for scrolling and swiping up and down are too close together and may result in unintentional interactions. <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>
                      <li><p><strong>3.3.2</strong><br>There is information on the card that is fairly useless, and even more so for when the user is intentionally looking at other information like recent transactions. We believe it would be a good idea to implement this visual aid in helping users view more of the content that is important to them <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V2)</p></li>
                      <li><p><strong>3.3.3</strong><br>Due to the unexpected surprise, we decided to remove this feature temporarily for version 4, since many of the users are fairly new to this application. We designed these features as shortcuts in mind, but it seems as though they may be ill-timed or prioritised in the design iterations too early <br>(Change made for High Fidelity V2)</p></li>

Unfortunately, there is a level of depth that viewing a self-managed fund requires that would greatly increase the complexity of the app design. Thus, in ideation, we found that presenting investment information through the use of managed funds aligns closer to the current depth of information that is provided by superannuation or personal banking. We understand that information like stock prices and volatility are incredibly important to self-managed funds, however, this is not something that application is currently designed to do. <br>(Unchanged)</p></li>

For zooming in and out, users can currently view the graph in different time periods, albeit set to daily, weekly, monthly or yearly; and they can also tap the left and right arrows to shift backwards or forwards through the data.

However, we cannot disregard this observation as the user did not mentally connect ‘budgeting’ to ‘settings’. Rather, as they continued to think aloud, they were trying to associate the word ‘Budgeting’ to something they might recognise in the Track screen.

              <li><p><strong>1.4.7</strong><br>Implementing features like this were part of other design concepts prior to this application, however, were ultimately left out in this initial design due to the increased complexity and density of information being presented to the user. We do agree that this is something that the application should have, since all the data is there, but for now is something we may push to the backlog in order to focus on improving what is currently there <br>(Backlogged)</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>2.2.3</strong><br>This is user interaction that should be implemented, however, is a level of customizability that would introduce some new features into the application. While we would love to implement this into the design, we felt as though it was something to put into the backlog <br>(Backlog)</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>2.2.5</strong><br>The POS transactional information would provide a great level of recognition and recall for the user, while also possibly providing a depth of information that could potentially solve the problem identified. This is something to put into the backlog, as it extends the current design into developing new features <br>(Backlog)</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>2.3.4</strong><br>This is functionality that could provide a lot of value for the user, and will be considered in the next iteration <br>(Backlog)</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>2.6.8</strong><br>This is something we considered when first implementing budgeting into the application. We like the idea of the application enforcing users to stick to their budget and even considered maybe having a password you have to input to change it. However, we decided to move this to the backlog as this wasn’t fully worked out in time <br>(Backlog)</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>3.4.3</strong><br>This level of graph viewability could turn out to become a great feature of the app, but at the moment these functions are available with limitations. For zooming in and out, users can currently view the graph in different time periods, albeit set to daily, weekly, monthly or yearly; and they can also tap the left and right arrows to shift backwards or forwards through the data. Perhaps this advanced level of graph control could be considered for functionality beyond MVP <br>(Backlog)</p></li>
