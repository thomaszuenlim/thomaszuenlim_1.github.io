          From our user testing, it was clear that there were several key features that we had to push into our backlog in order to focus on improving the key features of Lydian Money.
<br><br>
There are several features that were suggested by our testers which we would have loved to implement into the design. However, with so many requiring new functionality to be designed and fit in, we realised very quickly that there was a point when we need to ask ourselves, ‘is implementing this new feature more important than improving something else that is already there?’. Unfortunately, we had to make this decision point at a handful of points in time, which resulted in a backlog that piled up.
<br><br>
There were also some additional questions that we still had ourselves, about the true functionality behind this application.
<br><br>
1. Some people have super accounts that are linked to their banks? How would this work?<br>
2. Some people also have super accounts that are accessible via TFN, so will the app require this information?<br>
3. Account sharing options? Some people share banking accounts with their family or partners, and while they might have a shared account, they also have their own to manage so how could this be implemented?<br>
4. Implementation of data analytics? I.e. ‘You’re spending 5% more than you did this time last year’<br><br>

In reflection, there were several things that were learnt through this entire design process.
<br><br>
Laziness in the design process can be costly not just to the user, but to our testers - we saw this in our introduction of the ‘view budget’ screen in Paper Prototype to as several testers thought that the number was for the budget that was set, not the amount that was actually spent. This was because we decided to be a bit lazy and keep $5800 as the value, but changed the category amounts to end in either .05 or .95 so it would seemingly add up to a round value.
<br><br>
Additionally, there have been a lot of insights into features like budgeting or edge case scenarios that we never thought of. As we continued to test these aspects that we didn’t know about started to become aspects that we knew we didn’t know about, and it was comforting to see that as the iterations continued into higher fidelity, the Lydian Money picture was coming together with greater confidence
<br><br>
So next steps? We feel like there is more than enough improvements to work on that could be implemented for another round of high fidelity user testing. Additionally, outside of the app, we believe that the move to Open Banking in Australia could create a large shift in the way the Australians deal with their money - and we're excited for the potential of applications like these.
